This is a simple Spring MVC controller with the one extra <strong>@SessionAttributes</strong> annotation. It indicates that in the controller¡¯s methods can be assigned some values to arguments of the annotation. In this example I declared just one session attribute with the name ¡°thought¡°. That¡¯s mean I can put some object into <strong>modelAndView</strong> using <strong>addObject()</strong> method, and it will be added to the session if the name of the object will be the same as the name of argument in <strong>@SessionAttributes</strong>. The last thing I make use of <strong>setViewName()</strong> of <strong>modelAndView</strong> to set index.jsp for display session attribute ¡°thought¡°.
